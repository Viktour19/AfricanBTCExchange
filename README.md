What is African BTC Exchange?
-------------------

Attending the online coursera course of June 2013 named StartupEngineeringi, an African Bitcoin Exchange Network was proposed as one of the Forum's Thread.

AfricanBTCExchange is released under the terms of the MIT license. See `LICENCE` for more
information or see http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

Development process
-------------------

Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when they are **sure**
their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a good thing.
Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches if the code doesn't
match the project's coding conventions or are controversial.

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.

This is an open project and all are encouraged to contribute.

Testing
-------

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write unit tests for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code.

Unit tests for the core code are in `test/`.
